Time Warp
Time Warp follows a time traveller who must go back in time to collect artifacts and gather fuel to get to the next time period. 

- Arrow keys control movement

- Use your bubble-like shield to ricochet projectiles from dinosaurs and Roman soldiers

- Fill your fuel gage up and then go back to your time machine to travel to the next level. 

- Beware! When you gather artifacts you change the flow of time, which might cause mix ups in the past....

I wanted to create something with a mechanic that let me try something a little outside of the box. I decided to go with the time traveller who ricochets bullets because I think it allows for something a little different but also stays in the shmup genre. I also really like the idea of a stylized game, so having something a little "Back to the Future"- esque is a little cool. This game will involve a time traveller who is trying to collect artifacts without disrupting the flow of time. Disrupting the flow of time is destroying enemies with your own gun or causing damage to the area that was obviously caused by a time traveller. This means that often a better way to navigate enemies in the game will involve ricocheting projectiles from an enemy instead of shooting them with bullets from your own gun, this being part of the puzzle solving element of the game, that the player must decide when it's useful to destroy something outright, vs. trying to evade or outsmart the enemy. Another main concept in the game will be that the player must collect fuel cells that power the time machine and allow you to get to the next level. This means that the level isn't timed, but instead you need enough fuel to get to the next level, but also allows the player to decide if they want to continue on a level even if they have enough fuel, it might be beneficial to keep gathering items or collecting more fuel to guarantee your survival in the next level. The player will have a pretty standard health bar that allows the enemies to attack with projectiles and kill the player (resulting in a level starting over). Sometimes the player will have to solve puzzles like ricocheting bullets around corners to stop a TREx from immediately stomping on you (for example). These are the general rules of the game. The conflict comes in the form of the enemies who try to stop the time traveller from collecting their artifacts, as well as the time traveller being challenged to leave as little damage behind as possible, due to time being disrupted if you do. Resource Management is one of the most important things within this game, due to having to juggle fuel and artifact collection as well as having to weigh the pros and cons of using your own gun to kill things, as it ends up causing you to die if you change the flow of time too much. This means if you use your own bullets early on, you may have trouble later in the game. This resource management is one of the chief constraints of the game and the cause of most of the puzzle elements. This game will be a player vs. game type, and involves the playing trying to outsmart the enemies through time. The game will end when the player gets back to present time with as many artifacts as possible (resulting in a higher or lower score).
